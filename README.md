## Hey there 👋

I’m Dhruv, an Electrical Engineering M.S. student in Los Angeles focused on Machine Learning. I currently enjoy building clean, efficient ML pipelines and exploring the possibilities of where AI can take us.

These days I’m focused on:

- Machine Learning Theory, specifically Supervised Learning
- Python, Pytorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Small, thoughtful projects with polish

---
**Some projects I have been working on:**

- [AI Network Degradation Detection](https://github.com/Dhruvq/networkdeg) - An app that predicts short-term network performance degradation using internet telemetry from RIPE Atlas using XGBoost with SMOTE. Check out the current system health [here!](http://54.215.23.12/)
- [Counselor AI](https://github.com/Dhruvq/counselorAI/) - A RAG agent designed to assist USC's MS ECE students by answering questions regarding their degree using only official university documentation.
